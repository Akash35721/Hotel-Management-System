"Tour de Atlantis" is a hotel based on the legendary story of Atlantis. The hotel is named after the fictional lost island described by Plato. Atlantis, according to the story, was a powerful and advanced civilization ruled by Poseidon. "Tour de Atlantis" embraces this myth by offering guests an immersive experience inspired by the rich culture and grandeur of Atlantis. The hotel's theme revolves around the island's architecture, culture, and the god Poseidon. However, it also serves as a cautionary reminder about the consequences of hubris and the importance of respecting the power of the sea, embodied by Poseidon, the god of the sea. Guests can enjoy a unique stay that combines luxury with a connection to this mythical narrative.
