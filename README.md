The Name of our project is Tour de Atlantis :


the story goes as follows 
Atlantis is a fictional lost island mentioned in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias. The story of Atlantis is told to Plato by Critias, who says that he heard it from his grandfather, who heard it from Solon, an Athenian statesman who lived in the 6th century BC.

According to Plato, Atlantis was a large island located in the Atlantic Ocean, beyond the Pillars of Hercules (generally assumed to mean the Strait of Gibraltar). Atlantis was ruled by Poseidon, the god of the sea, and its inhabitants were said to be a powerful and advanced civilization.

Plato describes Atlantis in great detail, including its geography, architecture, and culture. The island was said to be surrounded by three concentric rings of land and water, and it was home to a number of magnificent buildings, including a temple to Poseidon and a palace for the kings of Atlantis.

The Atlanteans were said to be skilled in many areas, including agriculture, engineering, and navigation. They were also said to have a strong military, and they conquered many lands around the Mediterranean Sea.

However, the Atlanteans eventually became corrupt and arrogant. They began to neglect their gods and to misuse their power. As a result, Zeus decided to punish them. He caused a massive earthquake and flood that destroyed Atlantis and submerged it into the ocean.

The story of Atlantis has fascinated people for centuries. There have been many attempts to find evidence of its existence, but none have been successful. Some scholars believe that Atlantis is a complete myth, while others believe that it may be based on a real event, such as the eruption of the island of Thera in the Aegean Sea around 1500 BC.

Regardless of whether or not Atlantis was a real place, its story continues to capture the imagination of people around the world. It is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of respecting the gods.

Poseidon is the central figure in the story of Atlantis. He is the god who creates Atlantis and gives it to his son, Atlas, to rule. Poseidon also gives the Atlanteans many gifts, including a powerful navy and a vast knowledge of the sea.

However, Poseidon is also the one who destroys Atlantis in the end. When the Atlanteans become corrupt and arrogant, Zeus decides to punish them. Poseidon, as the god of the sea, is the one who carries out Zeus's punishment by causing a massive earthquake and flood that destroys Atlantis.

Poseidon's role in the story of Atlantis is complex and multifaceted. He is both the creator and destroyer of the lost city. He is a god who is both benevolent and malevolent. He is a reminder that even the most powerful gods can be both merciful and wrathful.

In addition to his role as the creator and destroyer of Atlantis, Poseidon is also a symbol of the power and danger of the sea. The sea is a source of life and abundance, but it can also be a force of destruction. Poseidon is a reminder that we should always respect the power of the sea and never take it for granted.

The story of Atlantis is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of respecting the gods. It is also a reminder that even the most powerful civilizations can be destroyed if they become corrupt and arrogant. Poseidon's role in the story is central to its meaning and message.
